ï»¿Step 1: create the spring start project
right click in the explorer and create a new spring start project
rename project
select Java 8
change the packaging from Jar to War
rename the Package com.abby.(projectname all lowercase)
select 'Spring Boot DevTools' AND 'Spring Web'
launch project

Step 2: Setup the controller package
right click the package com.abby.(projectname) and create a new package with .controllers added to the end
(this is where our controllers will go)

Step 3: Setup the views folder
go through the folders src main webapp (should be near the bottom) and add a new folder called "WEB-INF" in webapp
(this is where our JSPs go)

now right click WEB-INF, add new (go to other add bottom of selection) and add a jsp file.
Traditionally, the first one is called 'index'

once you have created a jsp file add this to the top:
<%@ taglib prefix = "c" uri = "http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"%>
(we need this to use c:out ect. to display data on our html. This will have to go on every page we created)

Step 4: build dependencies needed for JSTL to work
now, go to pom.xml (should be at the bottom of the explorer) and add these dependencies:
<dependency>
                <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
                <artifactId>jstl</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
                <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
                <artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
        </dependency>
(these dependencies are needed to make JSTL (AKA Jinja) work on our JSP (AKA HTML) )

now, go to src/main/resources/application.properties in the explorer and add this:
spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/
(MVC means Models, Views and Controllers. we're telling the computer that our "views" folder is called WEB-INF)
